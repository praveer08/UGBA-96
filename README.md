# UGBA-96-Data-and-Decisions
The objective of this connector course is to provide an understanding of how data and statistical
analysis can improve managerial decision-making. Students learn how to ask well-posed ques-
tions, find or collect relevant data, and apply appropriate statistical methods to solve problems 
and make better business and policy decisions. We will explore statistical methods for gleaning
insights from economic and social data, with an emphasis on approaches to identifying causal
relationships. We will discuss how to design and analyze randomized experiments and introduce
econometric methods for estimating causal effects in non-experimental data.
To introduce and motivate these methods, we will drawn on a variety of business and social
science applications, including advertising, management, online marketplaces, labor markets,
and education. We will build on the programming tools you develop in Data 8 to analyze real
economic and social data.
This course is 2 units. This course, in combination with the Data 8 Foundations course, satisfies
the statistics prerequisite for admissions to Haas.
